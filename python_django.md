# Framework and Library
A framework is used for building and deploying an application quickly. **When we use a framework, we can use resources to facilitate faster development and a greater user experience**.

A library is used to enhance the functionality of an application. **If we develop our own library, we can use the functions in many applications**.

# Difference between Framework and Library
| Framework                                                                                                        | Library                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Provides ready to use tools, standards, templates, and policies for fast application development                 | Provides reusable function for our code                                 |
| The framework controls calling of libraries for our code                                                         | Our code controls when and where to call a library                      |
| To leverage the benefit of a framework, a fresh application can be developed following the framework’s guideline | Library can be added to augment the features of an existing application |
| Easy to create and deploy an application                                                                         | Facilitates program binding                                             |
| Helps us to develop a software application quickly                                                               | Helps us to reuse a software function                                   |
| Intent of a framework is to reduce the complexity of the software development process                            | Intent of a library is to provide reusable software functionality       |

# Django
Django is a free and open-source, Python-based web framework that follows the model–template–views architectural pattern. It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation, an independent organization established in the US as a 501 non-profit.

### Why Django?
With Django, you can take web applications from concept to launch in a matter of hours. Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.

### Ridiculously fast.
Django was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible.

### Fully loaded.
Django includes dozens of extras you can use to handle common web development tasks. Django takes care of user authentication, content administration, site maps, RSS feeds, and many more tasks — right out of the box.

### Reassuringly secure.
Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistakes, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery and clickjacking. Its user authentication system provides a secure way to manage user accounts and passwords.

### Exceedingly scalable.
Some of the busiest sites on the planet use Django’s ability to quickly and flexibly scale to meet the heaviest traffic demands.

### Incredibly versatile.
Companies, organizations and governments have used Django to build all sorts of things — from content management systems to social networks to scientific computing platforms.

##### You can find that several major companies employ Django for their development projects. Here are 9 global companies using Django:
1. Instagram 
2. National Geographic
3. Mozilla
4. Spotify
5. Pinterest
6. Disqus 
7. Bitbucket
8. Eventbrite 
9. Prezi
